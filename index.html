    <br>
    <p><b>In first paragraph I used normal syntax of color.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>In second paragraph I used "rgb" syntax of color, which means r = red, g = green, b = blue and these are the values of rgb like (223, 130, 54)</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>In third paragraph I used "Hex Value" syntax of color, which contains alphabets and numbers like "#ff4532"</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>This class is small because this topic is not so much important because it will not help you much but even I taught it because in some cases you will have to use it.</p>
